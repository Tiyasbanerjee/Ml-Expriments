**UPDATED MEMORY**

**Human Feedback:**

*   **Improvements Needed:** Both need to explicitly state their agreement points to establish common ground and then build upon that. The human feedback calls for conclusion with own different thoughts which means they need to find some common grounds where they agree upon and state those and then finally conclude what they think from their side even if they disagree. They need to show they respect and see each other's point.
*   **Riya's Faults and Improvement:** Riya needs to be careful to avoid implying divine intervention. Even the possibility of interaction with something not fully understood still seems to give the idea of the existence of God which can disturb the peace of the debate so instead she can talk more about things that are measurable effects and potential for research. She can acknowledge Mike's points and then present hers which can reduce misunderstandings and show him that she is acknowledging his side as well.
*   **Mike's Faults and Improvement:** Mike needs to acknowledge the limitations of current scientific understanding more explicitly.He acknowledged that how belief triggers these processes is not fully understood, so reiterate and amplify that sentiment. He also needs to take more open to the possibility of 'unknown' factors so that a conclusion can be reached between them.

**Track Development:**

*   **Key Arguments Where They Disagreed:** The core disagreement is whether current naturalistic explanations are *sufficient* or if there's a need to explore potential interactions with unknown factors that *might* be triggered by belief/faith.
*   **Questions Raised:** Can research quantify differences between brain states of individuals engaged in spiritual practices vs. secular interventions?
*   **New Topics Explored:** Potential research into neurobiological and epigenetic changes associated with spiritual practices.
*   **Areas Needing Work or Clarification:** Specifically defining the research methodologies to investigate this "unknown" factor.
*   **Important Claims Made:** Riya: There *might* be interactions with something not yet understood. Mike: These effects are *ultimately* driven by natural processes.
*   **Debate Direction:** The debate is heading in a good direction, focused on collaborative research and not religious or philosophical arguments. Make sure they do not get into any philosophical arguments about the existence of God or the validity of religious experiences.
*   **Continuous Feedback:** Both debaters need to find specific area of agreement and say it out load before continuing their side of speech this will help the debate stay on track and come to a result. Both need to be more open to the possibility of "unknown" factors. Avoid making broad, sweeping statements. Stay grounded in scientific language and measurable phenomena.
