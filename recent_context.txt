RIYA_SAID_IS:** While acknowledging the role of naturalistic explanations and the placebo effect, the consistent reports of profound shifts in values and lasting behavioral changes after transformative religious experiences, coupled with the success of Religious coping and Trauma Informed Care, suggest an interaction between natural processes and something not yet fully understood. We should be looking to explore these "interactions" scientifically and not merely dismiss them as natural.
MIKE_SAID_IS:** Altruism and transformation from religious coping can be explained through natural processes like hormone release and social dynamics, suggesting that any perceived benefit is a result of innate human biology and/or social conditioning rather than divine intervention.
RIYA_SAID_IS:** While acknowledging Mike's emphasis on natural processes, I've highlighted the significant unknowns in understanding the magnitude and consistency of transformations observed in religious contexts. I am also suggesting collaborative research is warranted to investigate potential unique mechanisms triggered by faith-based interventions.
